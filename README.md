Demo uses RC Car: Tolls is an on chain mechanism for protecting geographic areas from overloading. Individuals are able to reserve 10x10m squares plots of land and a smart contract ensures any visitors to the location are charged at TOLL fee for the right to access.

Tolls is an application of blockchain technology to manage geographic resources and spaces.

The main idea behind "Tolls" is to use the decentralized and secure nature of the blockchain to manage access to physical spaces. Here's how the system works:

Ownership and Reservation of Plots: Individuals can purchase ownership rights to 10x10m square plots of land on the blockchain. These could represent real-world geographic locations or in the future virtual spaces in an augmented reality. The ownership is stored on chain, making it verifiable and indisputable.

A smart contract governs the interactions between owners and visitors of the plots. This contract ensures that any visitors to a plot of land are charged a toll fee for the right to access it. The visitor to the plot submits GPS data on chain when they visit relevant areas. We haven't had time to implement this yet at this hackathon but we plan to verify the legitimacy of the GPS coordinates by using a consensus mechanism involving other nearby users on some peer to peer network.

This system could prevent the overloading or overcrowding of certain spaces, as the tolls would incentivise individuals to spread out to less densely visited areas. This would be particularly useful in scenarios where there is a scarcity of space or where certain areas are overly accessed, or for conservation efforts of wild spaces.
